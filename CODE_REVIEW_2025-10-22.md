## Critical Issues Analysis

### üî¥ **CRITICAL - Production Blockers**

#### 1. TypeScript Compilation Errors 
**Files Affected:** `SessionProvider.tsx`, `FileTable.tsx`, `useImuIngress.tsx`, `AuthProvider.tsx`

**Issues:**
```typescript
// SessionProvider.tsx - Null safety violations
a.setCollect?.(false); // 'a' is possibly null
b.start?.(); // 'b' is possibly null

// FileTable.tsx - Missing type annotations
function RowInfo({ filePath, file, theme }) { // Implicit 'any' types

// AuthProvider.tsx - Incorrect Firebase call
initializeApp(); // Expected 1-2 arguments, but got 0
```

**Impact:** Build failures, runtime crashes, type safety compromised

#### 2. Missing Error Boundaries
**Current State:** No app-wide error handling for production crashes

**Risk Areas:**
- BLE operations (device disconnections, pairing failures)
- Session management (GPS failures, file write errors)
- Authentication flows (network failures, token expiry)
- File operations (storage full, permission denied)

**Recommendation:** Implement error boundaries around each major provider

#### 3. Memory Management Concerns
**Potential Issues:**
- BLE subscriptions not properly cleaned up
- useEffect hooks missing cleanup functions
- Real-time data collection without bounds checking
- No disposal of GPS watchers

### üü° **HIGH PRIORITY - User Experience**

#### 4. Limited Loading States
**Missing Feedback:**
- BLE scanning progress
- Session start/stop operations
- File upload progress
- Authentication flows
- Device connection status

#### 5. BLE Connection Stability
**Current Limitations:**
- Basic error handling for disconnections
- No automatic reconnection
- Limited graceful degradation
- Minimal user guidance for connection issues

#### 6. Hook Dependency Issues
**ESLint Warnings:**
```typescript
// Missing dependencies in useCallback/useEffect
useCallback(() => {
  // Uses 'notify' and 'sport' but not in deps
}, [writerRef]); // Missing: notify, sport

useEffect(() => {
  // Complex effect with incomplete dependencies
}, [sessionActive]); // Missing: writerRef, emitSessionEvent
```

### üü¢ **MEDIUM PRIORITY - Code Quality**

#### 7. Dead Code and Comments
**Locations:**
- `SessionStatusPanel.tsx`: Large commented sections
- `DeviceBox.tsx`: Commented function blocks
- `useImuIngress.tsx`: Redundant comment blocks
- Multiple files: Unused imports

#### 8. Performance Optimization Opportunities
- No React.memo usage for expensive components
- Potential re-render cascades in real-time components
- File list could benefit from virtualization
- No component profiling or optimization

#### 9. Accessibility Gaps
- Missing accessibility labels
- No keyboard navigation
- Limited screen reader support
- No high contrast mode
- Touch target sizes not optimized
